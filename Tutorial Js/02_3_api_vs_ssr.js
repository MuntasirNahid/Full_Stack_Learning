//API vs SSR

//in express when we use the word api we mean setting up an http interface to interact with our data.
//data is sent using json.which means javascript object notation and in order to send back our response we will use res.json()


//SSR is server side rendering where we will setup templates and send back entire html and css and javascript to ourselves and
//we are going to do it using res.render()
